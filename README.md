## Introduction
Discover Whisper-TikTok, an innovative AI-powered tool that leverages the prowess of **Edge TTS**, **OpenAI-Whisper**, and **FFMPEG** to craft captivating TikTok videos. Harnessing the capabilities of OpenAI's Whisper model, Whisper-TikTok effortlessly generates an accurate **transcription** from provided audio files, laying the foundation for the creation of mesmerizing TikTok videos through the utilization of **FFMPEG**. Additionally, the program seamlessly integrates the **Microsoft Edge Cloud Text-to-Speech (TTS) API** to lend a vibrant **voiceover** to the video. Opting for Microsoft Edge Cloud TTS API's voiceover is a deliberate choice, as it delivers a remarkably **natural and authentic** auditory experience, setting it apart from the often monotonous and artificial voiceovers prevalent in numerous TikTok videos.

## How it Works

Employing Whisper-TikTok is a breeze: simply modify the [video.json](video.json). The JSON file contains the following fields:

- `series`: The name of the series.
- `part`: The part number of the video.
- `text`: The text to be spoken in the video.
- `outro`: The outro text to be spoken in the video.
- `tags`: The tags to be used for the video.

Summarizing the program's functionality:

> Furnished with a structured JSON dataset containing details such as the **series name**, **video part number**, **video text** and **outro text**, the program orchestrates the synthesis of a video incorporating the provided text and outro. Subsequently, the generated video is stored within the designated `output` folder.

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>

The program conducts the **sequence of actions** outlined below:

1. Retrieve **environment variables** from the optional .env file.
2. Validate the presence of **PyTorch** with **CUDA** installation. If the requisite dependencies are **absent**, the **program will use the CPU instead of the GPU**.
3. Download a random video from platforms like YouTube, e.g., a Minecraft parkour gameplay clip.
4. Load the OpenAI Whisper model into memory.
5. Extract the video text from the provided JSON file and initiate a **Text-to-Speech** request to the Microsoft Edge Cloud TTS API, preserving the response as an .mp3 audio file.
6. Utilize the OpenAI Whisper model to generate a detailed **transcription** of the .mp3 file, available in .srt format.
7. Select a **random background** video from the dedicated folder.
8. Integrate the srt file into the chosen video using FFMPEG, creating a final .mp4 output.
9. Upload the video to TikTok using the TikTok session cookie. For this step it is required to have a TikTok account and to be logged in on your browser. Then the required `cookies.txt` file can be generated using [this guide available here](https://github.com/kairi003/Get-cookies.txt-LOCALLY). The `cookies.txt` file must be placed in the root folder of the project.
10. Voila! In a matter of minutes, you've crafted a captivating TikTok video while sipping your favorite coffee ‚òïÔ∏è.

## Web App (Online)

There is a Web App hosted thanks to Streamlit which is public available in HuggingFace, just click on the link that will take you directly to the Web App.
> https://huggingface.co/spaces/MatteoFasulo/Whisper-TikTok-Demo

## Local Installation

Whisper-TikTok has undergone rigorous testing on Windows 10, Windows 11 and Ubuntu 23.04 systems equipped with **Python versions 3.8, 3.9 and 3.11**.

If you want to run Whisper-TikTok locally, you can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MatteoFasulo/Whisper-TikTok.git
```

> However, there is also a Docker image available for Whisper-TikTok which can be used to run the program in a containerized environment.

# Dependencies

To streamline the installation of necessary dependencies, execute the following command within your terminal:

```python
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

It also requires the command-line tool [**FFMPEG**](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers:

```bash
# on Ubuntu or Debian

sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# on Arch Linux

sudo pacman -S ffmpeg

# on MacOS using Homebrew (<https://brew.sh/>)

brew install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Chocolatey (<https://chocolatey.org/>)

choco install ffmpeg

# on Windows using Scoop (<https://scoop.sh/>)

scoop install ffmpeg
```

>Please note that for optimal performance, it's advisable to have a GPU when using the OpenAI Whisper model for speech recognition. However, the program will work without a GPU, but it will run more slowly. This performance difference is because GPUs efficiently handle fp16 computation, while CPUs use fp32 or fp64 (depending on your machine), which are slower.

## Web-UI (Local)

To run the Web-UI locally, execute the following command within your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port=8501 --server.address=0.0.0.0
```

## Command-Line

To run the program from the command-line, execute the following command within your terminal:

```bash
python main.py 
```

### CLI Options

Whisper-TikTok supports the following command-line options:

```
python main.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --model TEXT              Model to use [tiny|base|small|medium|large] (Default: small)
  --non_english             Use general model, not the English one specifically. (Flag)
  --url TEXT                YouTube URL to download as background video. (Default: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=intRX7BRA90>)
  --tts TEXT                Voice to use for TTS (Default: en-US-ChristopherNeural)
  --list-voices             Use `edge-tts --list-voices` to list all voices.
--random_voice              Random voice for TTS (Flag)
  --gender TEXT             Gender of the random TTS voice [Male|Female].
  --language TEXT           Language of the random TTS voice(e.g., en-US)
  --sub_format TEXT         Subtitle format to use [u|i|b] (Default: b) | b (Bold), u (Underline), i (Italic)
  --sub_position INT        Subtitle position to use [1-9] (Default: 5)
  --font TEXT               Font to use for subtitles (Default: Lexend Bold)

```

> If you use the --random_voice option, please specify both --gender and --language arguments. Also you will need to specify the --non_english argument if you want to use a non-English voice otherwise the program will use the English model. Whisper model will auto-detect the language of the audio file and use the corresponding model.

## Usage Examples

- Generate a TikTok video using a specific TTS model and voice:

```bash
python main.py --model medium --tts en-US-EricNeural
```

- Generate a TikTok video without using the English model:

```bash

```

- Use a custom YouTube video as the background video:

```bash
python main.py --url https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ --tts en-US-JennyNeural
```

- Modify the font color of the subtitles:

```bash
python main.py --sub_format b --font_color #FFF000 --tts en-US-JennyNeural
```
