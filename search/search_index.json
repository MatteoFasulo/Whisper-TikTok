Harnessing the capabilities of OpenAI's Whisper model, Whisper-TikTok effortlessly generates an accurate transcription from provided audio files, laying the foundation for the creation of mesmerizing TikTok videos through the utilization of FFMPEG. Additionally, the program seamlessly integrates the Microsoft Edge Cloud Text-to-Speech (TTS) API to lend a vibrant voiceover to the video. Opting for Microsoft Edge Cloud TTS API's voiceover is a deliberate choice, as it delivers a remarkably natural and authentic auditory experience, setting it apart from the often monotonous and artificial voiceovers prevalent in numerous TikTok videos.</p>"},{"location":"#demo-video","title":"Demo Video","text":"<p>https://github.com/MatteoFasulo/Whisper-TikTok/assets/74818541/68e25504-c305-4144-bd39-c9acc218c3a4</p>"},{"location":"#installation","title":"Installation \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f","text":"<p>Whisper-TikTok has been tested in Windows 10, Windows 11 and Ubuntu 24.04 systems equipped with Python versions 3.11, and 3.12.</p> <p>If you want to run Whisper-TikTok locally, you can clone the repository using the following command:</p> <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/MatteoFasulo/Whisper-TikTok.git\n</code></pre> <p>Install the required dependencies using pip:</p> <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre> <p>However, we encourage the adoption of astral <code>uv</code> to install the required dependencies.
